====
- User-space DMA buffers: https://github.com/ikwzm/udmabuf

- Do not use NATURAL for slave offsets, but use an UNSIGNED(x downto 0) directly.

- Create a pan-tilt.vhd file which instantiates 2 PWM controllers.

- Using 128-bit fpga2hps bridge interface results in a segmentation fault when
  using the framebuffer in lab_4_0. It works fine with a 64-bit fpga2hps
  interface though.
