- User-space DMA buffers: https://github.com/ikwzm/udmabuf

- Do not use NATURAL for slave offsets, but use an UNSIGNED(x downto 0) directly.

- Create a pan-tilt.vhd file which instantiates 2 PWM controllers.

- Using 128-bit fpga2hps bridge interface results in a segmentation fault when
  using the framebuffer in lab_4_0. It works fine with a 64-bit fpga2hps
  interface though.

- Find horizontal back porch, front porch, ... for 320x240 LCDs.

- Install libncurses in the VM:
    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

- Check if we can use a more recent socfpga branch like 4.15 or something.

- Increase number of virtual buffers in lab 4.0 to 3 (instead of 2, because
  right now we don't see the blue color in fb_multiple_buffering_example.c)
