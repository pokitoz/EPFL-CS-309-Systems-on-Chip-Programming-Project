About
=====
This README describes the standard project structure that will be used in the
following courses:
    - CS-309 : Projet de Systems-on-Chip  (PSOC)
    - CS-473 : Embedded systems           (ES)
    - CS-476 : Real-time embedded systems (RTES)

Folder structure
================
IMPORTANT : Please read the following paragraphs VERY carefully...

            Make sure the project directory in located in some place such that
            its ABSOLUTE path contains NO SPACES.

            Make sure that any files/directories that you create as you advance
            in your designs also contain NO SPACES.

            Failing to satisfy these constraints will cause some of the tools
            used in the course to generate error messages, ultimately leading to
            non-functional designs (and, additionally, to much swearing directed
            towards the tools).

            We've been there (numerous) times, and want to avoid wasting your
            time debugging this sort of (useless) error :).

To facilitate US to help YOU, we kindly ask that you use the following folder
structure for all your projects.

<project_name>
├── hw
│   ├── hdl
│   │   ├── DE0_Nano_SoC_top_level.vhd
│   │   ├── DE0_Nano_top_level.vhd
│   │   └── DE1_SoC_top_level.vhd
│   ├── modelsim
│   └── quartus
│       ├── pin_assignment_DE0_Nano_SoC.tcl
│       ├── pin_assignment_DE0_Nano.tcl
│       └── pin_assignment_DE1_SoC.tcl
├── README
└── sw
    ├── hps
    │   ├── application
    │   ├── linux
    │   │   └── driver
    │   └── preloader
    └── nios
        └── application

We ask that you use the following guidelines for placing your various files:

    - Quartus Prime   projects              : hw/quartus
    - ModelSim-Altera projects              : hw/modelsim
    - Nios II SBT     projects              : sw/nios/application
    - ARM DS5         baremetal application : sw/hps/application
    - ARM DS5         linux     application : sw/hps/application
    - Linux           linux     driver      : sw/hps/linux/driver
    - SoC-FPGA        preloader             : sw/hps/preloader

    - YOUR hdl design files in hw/hdl
    - Qsys design files in hw/quartus

Note that for Eclipse-based tools (Nios II SBT & ARM DS5), the "project"
directories listed above are NOT what Eclipse calls the "workspace" directory
(generally asked when you start the program).

Please use a DIFFERENT folder (somewhere else on your machine) for Eclipse's
"workspace" directory. This directory generally contains bookkeeping information
needed for Eclipse to run, but is not related in any way to source files for the
projects you are designing!

FPGA development boards
=======================
We use 3 different FPGA development boards in these courses:
    - Terasic DE0-Nano     (Cyclone IV E : EP4CE22F17C6)
    - Terasic DE0-Nano-SoC (Cyclone V    : 5CSEMA4U23C6)
    - Terasic DE1-SoC      (Cyclone V    : 5CSEMA5F31C6)

    TCL Scripts
    ===========
    When creating your Quartus projects, remember to source the TCL script
    corresponding to your chosen development board. To source a TCL script, go
    to

        Tools > TCL Scripts...

    and execute the TCL script corresponding to the board you are using.

    NOTE: executing TCL scripts takes some time (~20-60 seconds), and Quartus
          may seem to have "frozen", but it is not the case. Please be patient
          and wait until the script is fully executed and returns.

    Top-level VHDL files
    ====================
    We provide top-level VHDL files for all development boards. These VHDL files
    contain the names of all available pins on the device.

    After creating your (empty) Quartus projects, add the VHDL file corresponding
    to your development board to the project. To add a file, go to

        Project > Add/Remove Files in Project...

    Once the file is added, you can set it as the top-level entity of your
    design by right-clicking on the VHDL file in the "files" tab of the Project
    Navigator and selecting "Set as Top-Level Entity".
